The idea is to realize a program that allows a good degree of automization in fitting and plotting experimental data. I list also some possible updates I can perform after
having completed the first step. The program can be helpful for fast and preliminary python data analysis or as a recalling function in my future analysis script. 

Simple idea:
- data load and management (still to decide which would be the degree of automization...)
- polynomila fit of a chosen degree (to be inserted at screen)
- superimposed plot (real and fitted curve with optional legend, colours, name of the axis etc...)

objective = obtain an useful superimposed graph that can give an idea for fast analysis  or  that can be useful for a very simple plot ready to be included in a report



Challenging idea:
- data load and management (still to decide which would be the degree of automization...) + uncertainty
- polynomial fit of a certain degree with data weighted by the respective uncertainties 
- superimposed plot (real and fitted curve with optional legend, colours, name of the axis, errorbar etc...)

objective = obtain a complete fitting procedure with a complete plot



Additional implementation:
- eventual additional scientific parameters that quantify the goddness of the fit
- to be continued
