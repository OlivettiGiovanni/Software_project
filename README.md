The idea is to realize a soft program that allows a good degree of automization in fitting and plotting experimental data. I list also some possible updates I can perform after
having completed the first step. The program can be helpful for fast python data analysis or as a recalling function in my future analysis script. 

Simple idea:
- data load and management (still to decide which would be the degree of automization...)
- polyfit of a chosen degree (to be inserted at screen)
- superimposed plot (real and fitted curve)

objective = obtain an useful superimposed graph that needs still some modification


Simple idea 2.0:
- data load and management (still to decide which would be the degree of automization...)
- possibility to insert from screen the name of x and y axis
- additional info that can be useful to obtain a complete final plot (colours for example...)
- polyfit of a chosen degree (to be inserted at screen)
- superimposed plot (real and fitted curve)

objective= provide with a completed final plot, no need of further modification


Challenging idea:
- data load and management (still to decide which would be the degree of automization...) + uncertainty
- possibility to insert from screen the name of x and y axis
- additional info that can be useful to obtain a complete final plot (colours for example...)
- linear regression with uncertainty propagation 
- eventual parameters such as chi square
- superimposed plot (real and fitted curve)

objective = same as above but wiht uncertainty!!

- polyfit with uncertainty propagation

- superimposed plot (real and fitted curve)

objective = totally general code to fit data with uncertainty
